For Pitt's CMPINF0010 Class

## What our python program does
The program prompts the user for a name input and their favorite number. Then the program tells whether the number is prime or not, and whether the number is even or not.

## Requirements
Because the program is written in a Jupyter notebook, it is recommended that you open it via Jupyter. Please see [https://jupyter.org/](https://jupyter.org/) for more information.

## Contributing
If you wish to contribute to the project, simply make a pull request and we will review the code.

## Rationale
### License
The license implemented in this project is a standard MIT License. I implemented this license since it grants anyone who obtains a copy of the files the ability to use, modify, and distribute copies of them. It has very few restrictions on reusing the material, and also has high license compatibility. The copyright and license notices must be preserved, but modifications may be distributed with different terms and different source code.

### Code of Conduct
Rather than attempting to re-invent the wheel, I did some research into various codes of conduct.
I find myself most in line with the GNU foundation's "Kind Communication Guidelines" which function as a code of conduct for discussions.
Superfluous lines were removed, and references to the GNU project were removed or changed to simply "this project" or "project".
